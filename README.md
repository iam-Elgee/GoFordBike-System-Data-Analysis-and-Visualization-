## by (Olamilekan Olugbayila)

# ---About Project:
This is the third project in the udacity Data Analysis Nano degree, The project workflow includes wrangling of the GoFord Bike system dataset and the analysis and Visualization of the data to produce key insights into the consumers' usage patterns and bike demand trends in the system.

#--- Description of Files in the Repo:
Files include:
>- (Part 1 exploratory): This is the jupyter notebook written in python language for the data exploratory phase of the project. Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate data exploration is carried out in this section, and over 15 different insights are generated via visualiuzations of the dataset

>- (Slides_Deck): This is a slides deck containing the Explanatory part of the workflow, It sumarrizes 3 key insights generated from the analysed data.

## Dataset Overview

> Ford GoBike is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. Like other bike share programs, Ford GoBike uses a fleet of sturdy, durable bikes that are locked into a system of docking stations spread out over the city. 

> The bikes are perfect for one-way travels because they may be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the network. The bikes can be used 365 days a year, seven days a week, and 24 hours a day. Riders who sign up as members or buy passes get access to all the bikes in the network.

> Preliminary Wrangling of the data set involved a cleaning up the datatype format of some of the columns and also removal of columns that were deemed unnecessary. This analysis only explored Ford GoBike's trip data for public containing rides recorded in Feb 2019.


## Summary of Findings

> In the analysis of this project, the system users are of two types mainly subscribers and regular/guest customers. The subscribers make the majority of the customer base at (90.5%). The most popular day for bike ride demand is Thursday, and from an overview, it appears that bike rides are taken by the subscriber customer base mainly for work commutes due to the short distance and ride durations found out from the analysis. Males dominate the system as the most common users, however analysis show that females ride for the longer durations. The age group between (25years - 40years) appear to be the popular users and a Typical ride duration for the guest customer type is around (8 - 18) minutes, while the subscribers ride for duration range of about (5- 12) minutes. Finally,  Mornings and Evenings see the highest demand for bike rides among both customer groups; Bike orders in the context of ride start time occurs mostly in the mornings (8-9am) and evenings(17 -18).


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the Explanatory phase, The focus is on the behavior and usage patterns of various customer kinds for the month of February 2019. 

> The services provided by the Ford GoBike System are available to both members and occasional users. Therefore, this section handles the discussion for  the daily and weekly routines of the goford system users. Furthermore, the week's demand for the bikes is visualized by the help of the heatmap. 

> Finally, to further highlight the variations in rental behavior,a boxplot of the trip time (in minutes) according to customer type is used.
